This is my first project when practicing the basics of data science. I spent over 2 months on it, mainly using it to practice my python skills, as well as other relavent libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and FBProphet. This data set was found on Kaggle.com.

Attached is the jupyter notebook I used to test on the data set, as well as a converted python script with the same code. Also attached is the data folder containing all of the csv files I read from. Lastly, a visualization dashboard to see the results of my analysis. 

Some insights I gained from analysing this data set:
1. Brazil is overwhelmingly the largest consumer and exporter of coffee among exporting countries. Behind them in exporting is Vietnam and Columbia, and behind them in consumption is Indonesia and Ethiopia.
2. There lies a strong correlation among countries producing and exporting coffee, and a somewhat strong correlation between countries consuming and exporting coffee.
3. Aribica is the most common type of coffee that countries export, followed by Robusta and a combination of both.
4. Most exporting countries have steadily increased coffee consumption since 1990.
5. Most exporting countries have steadily increased coffee production since 1990. Vietnam's increase is the most dramatic.
6. Congo has had the highest increase in coffee production while Cuba has had the highest increase in consumption
7. Coffee production in Brazil has increased faster than their consumption
8. Both the average retail price of coffee and the average pay to growers has fluctuated throughout the years. The retail price has increased slightly since 1990 while pay to growers has stagnated. Also, the pay to coffee growers remains comparatively low to the retail price.
9. The most common source of coffee is Mexico, followed by Columbia, Guatemala, and Brazil.
10. Pay to growers is projected to increase by 76% in the next 20 years.
11. The price of coffee is projected to increase by 26%.

I enjoyed this project as it seemed like a relavent data set to test on considering my love for coffee. admittedly, this project is far from perfect. The analysis is limited and the code can be sloppy at times, but it's my first project and I'm proud of it.

Special thanks to Rub Mulla's channel on YouTube, who's videos have helped me out a lot in learning how to conduct this project.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more.
